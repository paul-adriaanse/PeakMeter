## v1.1a

- Improved look: adjusted font size for PI code, frequency and signal strength

## Installation notes:

1. 	Download the last repository as a zip
2.	Unpack the PeakMeterPlugin.js and the PeakMeter folder with the peakmeter.js into the web server plugins folder (..fm-dx-webserver-main\plugins)
3. 	Restart the server
4. 	Activate the plugin it in the settings
5.	Calibrate the volume with volume rotary control (only Receiver with display)

## Important notes: 

- You can download an adapted version of the SignalMeterSmall for correct display in the peak meter box here: https://github.com/AmateurAudioDude/FM-DX-Webserver-Plugin-S-Meter
- If you use the volume slider to recalibrate the volume, you should save the determined reference volume in the web server settings under Tuner as the starting volume. This will restore this setting for all users when the website is accessed.

## Configuration options:

The following variables can be changed in the header of the script:

      volumeSliderValue               // Set the value 0.1-1.0 to reduce the input volume/sensitivity (default: 1.0)
      volumeSliderEnable              // set to 'true' to activate the manuel volume control (default: false)
      ConsoleDebug                    // set to 'true' to activate console information for debugging
      minVolumeThreshold = 0.5        // Threshold for audio display activation
      riseRate = 1.93                 // Rate of increase (the higher, the faster)
      amplificationFactor = 0.21      // Amplification factor
      bassReductionFactor = -10       // Reduction of bass frequencies (in dB)
      highPassCutoffFrequency = 1000  // Cutoff frequency for high-pass filter (in Hz)
